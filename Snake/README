Snake is a  a classic 2D video game where the objective is to control a line as it grows in length while preventing it from hitting the bounds or itself.
 
Game Description:
The game screen displays a snake (chain of dots with arrow as head) always in motion and a fruit (red dot) at a fixed point on the screen. 
The direction of the snake can be controlled (by wasd) in that it can switch its direction by either turning left or right at a time.
The objective of the snake is to eat the target fruit, which makes it grow in length. Conventionally, there is always only one fruit on the screen.
As the snake eats the fruit, it disappears, and another one appears at a random location.
The snake can die by eating itself (when it collides with itself) or by hitting the edge of the screen or any other obstacles. When the snake dies, a game-end screen should appear.
The game can pause and resume at any time. It can restart when it dead, and have a welcome screen for use description.
When game play, it has score, FPS, and speed at bottom of the game.

Control:
wasd: for snake to move.
p: to start game at inital welcome screen.
esc: to quit game at start, pause or game over state.
space: to pause game while play
r: to restart the game(back to welcome screen) at pause or game over state.

Enhancement:
1. added obstacles that the snake must avoid and gaps on the border that lets the snake wrap around to other side of the screen.
2. Power-ups: ">>" shape for eat to speed up or down randomly.
3. Power-ups: "diamond" shape for shrink the snake size in half.

Development Environment:
Mac with xcode, but works in Linux student environment by using Makefile.

FOR COMPILE, if you use Linux, you can first call "Make" to compile and link the file into file called snake.
Then you can run by "./snake" or "./snake 30 5", 30 for framrate and 5 for speed.

The speed unit is two block per secend for usability.
